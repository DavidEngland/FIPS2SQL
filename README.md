# FIPS2SQL
Node JS fetch FIPS codes using api.census.gov (You should get a key) and create SQL for WordPress for places, counties, states.
# FIPS2SQL Summary

FIPS2SQL is a Node.js project designed to fetch FIPS codes from the U.S. Census Bureau API for various geographical entities like places, counties, and states, and then generate SQL commands tailored for WordPress databases. Users are reminded to obtain an API key from api.census.gov for optimal functionality. Additionally, the project incorporates Zip Code Data from SimpleMaps.com, ensuring comprehensive and accurate geographical information.

## Project Background

The FIPS2SQL project was conceived as a direct result of our work with the Real Estate Intelligence Agency (REIA), focusing on the collection and analysis of IDX (Internet Data Exchange) data for various geographical entities such as cities, towns, and zip codes. This initiative aims to streamline the process of integrating comprehensive real estate data into WordPress databases, facilitating better access to up-to-date and accurate property listings and geographical information.

Our collaboration with REIA highlighted the need for a robust solution to fetch and organize FIPS codes, which are crucial for accurately mapping IDX data to the correct locations. By automating the generation of SQL commands tailored for WordPress, FIPS2SQL significantly enhances the efficiency of managing real estate data, ensuring that users have access to reliable and precise information for their decision-making needs.

Initially, the FIPS2SQL project concentrated on the Greater Huntsville, Alabama area, leveraging local IDX data to refine and test our methodologies. However, recognizing the broader applicability and demand for such a tool, we have since expanded our scope to include Tennessee, Georgia, and beyond. This expansion not only demonstrates the project's versatility and scalability but also underscores the potential for FIPS2SQL to serve a wide range of real estate markets and geographical locations.

For those interested in utilizing FIPS2SQL in other regions, it's important to note that a cloned version of this project may require customization, adaptation, and expansion to meet the specific IDX data and FIPS code requirements of the new area. This flexibility is a core aspect of FIPS2SQL, allowing it to be tailored to the unique needs of different real estate markets and geographical entities.
